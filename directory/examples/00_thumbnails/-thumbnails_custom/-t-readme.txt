h1. Custom Thumbnails

h2. Enhancer

If a -thumbnails-custom/ folder exists, any thumbnails within it will override the auto-generated -thumbnails/ folder content.

To create a custom thumbnail:

1. If it doesn't exist, create a folder called "-thumbnails-custom" within the same folder your images are in.

2. Design your custom thumbnails with any size you desire.

3. Giving your thumbnail the same filename as the image it is referencing.

3. Upload your custom thumbnail(s) to the "-thumbnails-custom" folder.
