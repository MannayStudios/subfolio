<p><small>Subfolio was created by <a href="http://www.area17.com" target="_blank">AREA 17</a>, an interactive agency in New York City and Paris, France. The application (originally called Filebrowser) was first developed in 2004 to help deliver designs and documents to clients. When the agency went international in 2006, it became the cross-office document server too.</small></p>
<p><small>Up until recently, AREA 17 also used Subfolio for their website. It was an assertion that the agency's work — not some fancy-pants website — was the focal-point. Today AREA 17 no longer uses Subfolio for their main website, however it is still used as their cross-office document server and of course the client studio too (their clients would hang them if they stopped).</small></p>
