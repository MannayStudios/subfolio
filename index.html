<h1>Orientation - Feature overview</h1>
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p><strong>How it works</strong> &#8212;&nbsp;Reads your file
system and instantly turns it into a website &#8212; folders become
sections, files become pages. But that's just the beginning...</p>
<p><strong>Many uses</strong> &#8212;&nbsp;Can be used as a public
website, a private client area, a secure document server or just
some place to put your stuff.</p>
<p><strong>One-off cost</strong> &#8212; Costs a mere $0
per-domain license. That includes all features and there is no
hidden or on-going cost to you.</p>
<h2>Instant Satisfaction</h2>
<p><strong>Installs on your server</strong> &#8212;&nbsp;Subfolio
is not a hosted service, giving you complete control over your
environment, your data and even the application itself.</p>
<p><strong>No database required</strong> &#8212;&nbsp;Drop the
application on your server and it works. No install files, no
database setup and no content management system either.</p>
<p><strong>Universal</strong> &#8212;&nbsp;Subfolio uses PHP5 and
has been optimized to work even within a basic shared hosting
environment.</p>
<p><strong>Easy-to-use</strong> &#8212;&nbsp;Drop files and folders
online using FTP or WebDAV. Organize. Reorganize. Whatever you do,
Subfolio will follow.</p>
<p><strong>Instant thumbnails</strong> &#8212;&nbsp;All
browser-viewable images will automatically get thumbnails. Upload a
few hundred images and you'll fall in love.</p>
<p><strong>Keyboard controls</strong> &#8212;&nbsp;Navigate files
via keyboard arrow keys.</p>
<p><strong>Mobile</strong> &#8212; Works on iPhone and Android
devices.</p>
<p><strong>Retrofit</strong> &#8212;&nbsp;Works with existing file
structures. Drop the file structure into Subfolio and you are done.
Your file structure will always remain in tact and as you want
it.</p>
<p><strong>Designed for Simplicity</strong>
&#8212;&nbsp;Streamlined interface allows for versatility and
focus, including easy to read URL&#8217;s and out-of-the box
SEO-friendliness.</p>
<h2>Infinite Possibilities</h2>
<p><strong>Beyond file browsing</strong>&nbsp;&#8212; Feature or
hide content, embed text and images, create pop-ups, shortcuts,
external links, slideshows, RSS embeds and so on.</p>
<p><strong>Access control</strong> &#8212;&nbsp;Create unlimited
users and groups, then assign them folder-level access as
needed.</p>
<p><strong>International</strong> &#8212;&nbsp;Change the interface
language, use any language character set and supports
foreign/special character in file names and urls.</p>
<p><strong>Themes</strong> &#8212;&nbsp;Switch themes without
touching your file structure or the application itself. And if you
know a little CSS, try customizing or creating your own.<br></p>
<p><strong>Color Palettes</strong> &#8212;&nbsp;Create your own
color palettes and switch them as often as you'd like.</p>
<p><strong>Have it your way</strong> &#8212;&nbsp;Configure the
interface, choose your mark-up preferences, manage your file kind
settings. We try to assume you know best.</p>
<p><strong>Developer friendly</strong> &#8212;&nbsp;Lightweight and
standards-compliant, get full assess to the un-obfuscated code.</p>
<p><strong>Make some cash</strong> &#8212;&nbsp;Install and
customize Subfolio for your clients. You'll make an easy buck and
they'll be thanking you for years to come.</p>

<h1>Orientation - How it works</h1>

<p>Subfolio reads your file system and instantly turns it into a
website &#8212; folders become sections, files become pages. But
that's just the beginning...</p>
<h2>The Basics</h2>
<p><strong>Engine</strong> &#8212;&nbsp;Functionality of Subfolio
using the Kahona PHP5 framework. You don't need to touch this.</p>
<p><strong>Directory</strong> &#8212; Default location where you
put all your content. You can change it in your settings files.
This folder will remain a clean structure of files and folders.</p>
<p><strong>Config</strong> &#8212;&nbsp;Configure your interface
and personal preferences.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Themes</strong>: Interface or "look n feel", themes can
be switched or customized. Themes also have options to turn on/off
different interface elements.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Users and Groups</strong>: Access control, if needed.
You can create users and assign them to groups. Then give a user or
a group access to folders as needed.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Settings</strong>: Global settings (eg. name of site,
preferences, etc.), manage your file kinds (eg. supported files,
preferences, download instructions, etc.) and change the interface
language.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Enhancers</strong>: These are little text snippet files
that live with your files and folders and change their behavior
(eg. add a comment, customize a thumbnail, embed text, etc.). Some
enhancers work on their own (eg. add a link to an external website
or popup, create a shortcut, etc.).</p>

<h1>Orientation - FAQ</h1>

<h2>Who can use Subfolio?</h2>
<p>Subfolio has been designed so that:</p>
<ul>
<li>anyone with FTP or WebDAV access can use it</li>
<li>anyone with little development experience can set it up</li>
<li>anyone who codes can really benefit (and even profit) from
it</li>
</ul>
<h3>&#8220;I have no experience at all&#8221;</h3>
<p>Get your Web-geek friend to set it up for you. You can also find
someone in the support forums. Or contact us and and we will do it
for cheap.</p>
<p><em>You can:</em> uploading content to Subfolio via FTP or
WebDAV.</p>
<h3>&#8220;I can't really code, but I can find my way
around&#8221;</h3>
<p>Great, this app is for you. You will be able to do most
everything you need pretty easily.</p>
<p><em>You also can:</em> install Subfolio, configure Subfolio
(including themes, access control, file kinds and language) and use
enhancers.</p>
<h3>&#8220;I code HTML/CSS&#8221;</h3>
<p>Even better, you are going to have some fun making it your
own.</p>
<p><em>You also can:</em> customize an existing theme and reate a
new theme (and of course share it with the community).</p>
<h3>&#8220;Let me at it, I eat all kinds of code for breakfast,
especially the PHP variety&#8221;</h3>
<p>Right on, have at it braw. If you do something cool, let us
know.</p>
<p><em>You also can:</em> change existing features and add new
features</p>
<h3>&#8220;I'm in the business of web design&#8221;</h3>
<p>Dude, there's money to be made. Many of your clients probably
could use Subfolio, so offer it to them. You can easily get a few
hundred bucks just for installing it and lots more for customizing
a theme or even the functionality.</p>

<h2>Hosting Considerations</h2>
<h3>&#8220;Does Subfolio have special hosting needs?&#8221;</h3>
<p>Nope. Subfolio was made to be <em>drop and go</em> as long as
you have the correct system requirements. Of course each server is
set-up differently so you might need to see with your system
administrator to make a slight adjustment.</p>
<h3>&#8220;Can I use Subfolio on a shared host or do I need a
dedicated server?&#8221;</h3>
<p>Yes you can. A dedicated server gives you more control of the
environment (eg. if you'd like to use special characters in URL's)
however all Subfolio features should work within a shared hosting
environment.</p>
<h3>&#8220;What do I need for storage and bandwidth?&#8221;</h3>
<p>It really depends on you. From this perspective, Subfolio is no
different than a normal website. If you are going to use Subfolio
as a file server, you should consider a dedicated server with lots
of storage. If you are famous and going to use Subfolio for your
portfolio website, you should consider a hosting account with high
bandwidth allowances.</p>
<h3>&#8220;What if I don't want it for my main website?&#8221;</h3>
<p>No problem, we recommend setting up a subdomain such as
studio.example.com. Its clean and purdy.</p>

<h1>Installation - Installing </h1>
<div>
    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>Subfolio uses standard text files and folders. There is no
    installation files, no database setup and it will run on most any
    shared hosting environment.</p>
    <h3>Package contents</h3>
    <ul>
    <li><code>directory/</code> is where you put all of your
    content</li>
    <li><code>config/</code> is the general settings, users &amp;
    groups and themes</li>
    <li><code>engine/</code> is something you do not touch (unless you
    are an experience coder who wants to change the app itself)</li>
    <li><code>htaccess</code> is a file sends instruction to your
    Apache server (must be renamed to .htaccess)</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>1-minute installation</h2>
    <ol>
    <li>Download the most recent version of Subfolio<br></li>
    <li>Unzip the Subfolio package<br></li>
    <li>Upload the package content to the ROOT of your domain (or
    subdomain)<br></li>
    <li>Rename the file htaccess to .htaccess<br></li>
    <li>Set all folder and file permissions to
    <code>755</code><br></li>
    <li>And you're done. Visit URL and you should see a welcome
    page.</li>
    </ol>
    <h3>Setting file permissions</h3>
    <p>Whether you are using S/FTP or WebDAV, it is very important to
    set permissions on upload to <code>755</code> and that it "applies
    to all enclosed items". If you encounter problems, in some
    instances, you may have to set it to <code>777</code>.</p>
    <h3>Enabling PHP5 on your server</h3>
    <p>Most servers have PHP5 installed, but maybe disabled by default.
    Depending on your server configuration, you may need to add a line
    of code to the <code>.htaccess</code> file in order to activate it
    (eg. <code>SetEnv PHP_VER 5</code>). See your system administrator
    or hosting provider documentation for further assistance.</p>
    <h3>Getting system information</h3>
    <p>To help with troubleshooting, visit the following URL on your
    domain: <code>yourdomain.com/engine/info</code></p>
    <h2>Installing within a folder</h2>
    <p>At this time, you can't install Subfolio within a folder. The
    entire package content must live at the root of your domain or
    subdomain.</p>
    <h2>Uninstalling</h2>
    <p>Delete or remove it from your server.</p>

<p>Subfolio is built so that updating is as easy as replacing the
<code>/engine/</code> folder, however sometimes we may tweak the
default theme or settings files in order to add additional
features. In most cases, we will make it so that theme or setting
updates are optional.</p>
<p>An "upgrade" by definition is a more significant release and
might affect the way things are done altogether. An upgrade &#8212;
if needed &#8212; will happen only with major releases.</p>
<h2>Before you start</h2>
<ul>
<li>read the <a href=
"https://github.com/area17/subfolio/blob/master/CHANGELOG.TXT">release
notes</a> (so you know what changes were made and what files were
affected)</li>
<li>make backups</li>
</ul>
<h2>DO NOT UPDATE <code>/directory/</code></h2>
<ul>
<li>this is where you keep your files, there will never be an
update to this folder</li>
</ul>
<h2>Updating <code>/engine/</code> (always required)</h2>
<ul>
<li>rename the existing to "engine_old" and upload the new in its
place</li>
<li>if you've made modifications to the engine, you will need to
redo or migrate over your changes manually</li>
</ul>
<h2>Updating <code>/config/settings/</code> and
<code>/config/users/</code> (optional)</h2>
<ul>
<li>upload and replace the "sample" files only</li>
<li>compare your files with the new sample files for new settings
(if applicable, see release notes)</li>
<li>copy new settings from sample to your files as needed</li>
</ul>
<h2>Updating <code>/config/themes/</code> (optional)</h2>

<h1>Installation - Hosting considerations</h1>
<div>
    <h2>&#8220;Does Subfolio have special hosting needs?&#8221;</h2>
    <p>Nope. Subfolio was made to be <em>drop and go</em> as long as
    you have the correct system requirements. Of course each server is
    set-up differently so you might need to see with your system
    administrator to make a slight adjustment.</p>
    <h2>&#8220;Can I use Subfolio on a shared host or do I need a
    dedicated server?&#8221;</h2>
    <p>Yes you can. A dedicated server gives you more control of the
    environment (eg. if you'd like to use special characters in URL's)
    however all Subfolio features should work within a shared hosting
    environment.</p>
    <h2>&#8220;What do I need for storage and bandwidth?&#8221;</h2>
    <p>It really depends on you. From this perspective, Subfolio is no
    different than a normal website. If you are going to use Subfolio
    as a file server, you should consider a dedicated server with lots
    of storage. If you are famous and going to use Subfolio for your
    portfolio website, you should consider a hosting account with high
    bandwidth allowances.</p>
    <h2>&#8220;What if I don't want it for my main website?&#8221;</h2>
    <p>No problem, we recommend setting up a subdomain such as
    studio.example.com. Its clean and purdy.</p>

<hr class='pagebreak'><a name='basic-usage-sharing-vs-showcasing'></a><h1>Basic Usage - Sharing vs. Showcasing </h1><div><h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>OK, you've just arrived to an existential fork in the road.
Subfolio can be used in two ways - to share files or to showcase
your work. What is the difference you ask?</p>
<h2>Sharing mode</h2>
<p>Subfolio can be used as a centralized repository to share files
within a team &#8212; internally, with clients or even in the
classroom. By default, Subfolio is configured for sharing mode.</p>
<p><em>You might want to learn more about:</em></p>
<ul>
<li>Access control</li>
</ul>
<h2>Showcase mode</h2>
<p>Subfolio can be used as a portfolio website or just some place
to showcase your stuff. Via theme options and settings, you can
simply configure Subfolio to be more "website-like". And enhancers
will take you the distance.</p>
<p><em>You might want to learn more about:</em></p>
<ul>
<li>Theme options</li>
<li>Language settings</li>
<li>Enhancers</li>
</ul></div><hr class='pagebreak'><a name='basic-usage-basic-setup'></a><h1>Basic Usage - Basic setup</h1><div><h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>There is little-to-nothing you need to know about Subfolio to
get started with basic usage. Subfolio is made to be extremely
configurable but only if you want. Here are the basic things that
most of you will probably want to customize.</p>
<p><strong>Working with YAML:</strong> Setting files must be
encoded as <code>Unicode (UTF-8)</code> for them to work properly.
Setting files use YAML, a human friendly data serialization
standard stored in plaintext files. Indentation, spacing and text
case are super important. Learn more at <a href=
"http://www.yaml.org">yaml.org</a>.</p>
<h2>Defining the name and url</h2>
<p>Go to <code>/config/settings/settings.yml</code> and change the
name of your website and the URL.</p>
<h2>Adding your logo and favicon</h2>
<p>Go to <code>/config/themes/default/options.yml</code> and
replace the Subfolio logo path. Can be a full or relative path.
Link it from another location or put your logo here:
<code>config/themes/default/images/logos/</code>.</p>
<p>You can change the favicon by going here:
<code>config/themes/default/images/logos/</code> and replacing the
Subfolio favicon named <code>favicon.png</code> with your custom
favicon.</p>
<h2>Switching themes</h2>
<p>If you are using the default theme, there is nothing to do. But
if you have another theme you'd like to use, then put it here:
<code>/config/themes/</code> and then go here:
<code>/config/settings/settings.yml</code> and change the
theme.</p>
<h2>Sharing vs. showcase</h2>
<p>OK, you've just arrived to an existential fork in the road.
Subfolio can be used in two ways - to share files or to showcase
your work. What is the difference you ask?</p>
<h3>Sharing mode:</h3>

<a name='basic-usage-about-interface-elements'></a>
<h1>Basic Usage - About interface elements</h1>
<div>
    <p>We&rsquo;ve included a few features within the interface (theme)
    that hopefully help the user experience.</p>
    <ul>
    <li>
    <p><strong>Collapse header</strong>: conserve window space by
    removing logo</p>
    </li>
    <li>
    <p><strong>Send page</strong>: email a link to the page</p>
    </li>
    <li>
    <p><strong>Make tiny url</strong>: uses tinyurl.com to generate a
    short URL</p>
    </li>
    <li>
    <p><strong>Updated since</strong>: option to see content updated
    since last week, last month or last visit (installs a cookie on
    users computer)</p>
    </li>
    </ul>
    <blockquote>
    <p><strong>Working with themes</strong>: Subfolio supports
    interchangeable themes. This means that you can switch the user
    experience (eg. look and feel) without touching the engine or your
    files.</p>
    <p><strong>Theme options</strong>: Most interface elements can be
    turned on/off within the theme option file
    <code>/config/themes/default/options.yml</code></p>
    </blockquote>
    <h2>Login and Log out (if applicable)</h2>
    <p>If a folder is password protected, the user will be prompted to
    enter their username and password. Once logged in, the user will
    have access to all folders they have been granted access too
    &mdash; individually or any group they belong too.</p>
    <ul>
    <li>
    <p><strong>Remember me</strong>: If user would like to stay logged
    in between visits, they have the option to select "Remember
    me".</p>
    </li>
    <li>
    <p><strong>Direct linking</strong>: If a file or folder exists
    within a password-protected folder, user will be prompted to
    login.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
    <p><strong>Access denied</strong>: If the user tries to click on a
    folder they do not have access to, they will get an access denied
    message.</p>
    </li>
    </ul>
    <blockquote>
    <p><strong>Important note</strong>: A user can see any files and
    folders that are within a folder they have access too. If you don't
    want your user to see the other files and folders, then you must
    give them access only to the folder you wish them to have access
    too.<br></p>
    </blockquote>
    <h2>Clean URLs</h2>
    <p>Nobody like long and complex web addresses. They are impossible
    to remember and hard to share. Subfolio URL's directly match the
    location of the file. So if you or your client knows the file path,
    you know the URL. And if you are using Subfolio as a public
    website, this is great for Search Engine Optimization (SEO)
    too.</p>
</div>


<hr class='pagebreak'><a name='basic-usage-adding-and-hiding-content'></a>
<h1>Basic Usage - Adding and hiding content</h1>
<div>
    <h2>Adding content (pages and sections)</h2>
    <p>Add your files and folders in the <code>/directory/</code>
    folder and Subfolio will instantly turn it into a website &#8212;
    folders become sections, files become pages. You can use any
    standard file kinds and Subfolio will recognize them automatically.
    If a file type is not recognized, it will be treated as a generic
    file kind.</p>
    <h3>Staying organized</h3>
    <p>Creating your website structure is just like organizing files
    and folders on your computer. But don't full victim to
    folder-structure madness by creating too many folders, it will make
    your website annoying to navigate. Our rule of thumb is to not
    create a subfolder unless you have at least 10+ files.</p>
    <h3>Ordering content</h3>
    <p>By default, content is ordered alphabetically by filename. Users
    can click on the column headers to sort by size, date or kind. You
    can also order content by appending a number (eg. 00, 01, 02, etc.)
    or date (eg. YY/MM/DD) to the beginning of the filename.</p>
    <h3>Working with existing file structures</h3>
    <p>Drop any existing file structure into Subfolio and you are done.
    Your file structure will remain in tact.</p>
    <h2>Hiding content</h2>
    <p>Any file or folder can be hidden by appending a dash
    <code>-</code> to the beginning of the file or folder name (eg.
    <code>-folder/</code> or <code>-image.jpg</code>). It will not
    appear within the navigation, however it will appear through direct
    URL (eg. example.com/-hidden).</p>
    <h3>Working in Draft-mode</h3>
    <p>If you are working on a new section, hide it with a dash. You
    can still view it via direct URL and when you are ready to go live,
    simply remove the dash.</p>
    <h2>Getting content uploaded to your server</h2>
    <ul>
    <li>
    <p><strong>S/FTP</strong> &#8212; You can use your favorite S/FTP
    app to connect to your server and upload files. Hint: some
    applications allow you to create local dropboxes or local mirrors
    in order to quickly upload items.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
    <p><strong>WebDAV</strong> &#8212; If you are a group of
    individuals, we've found it useful to set up WebDAV. If you don't
    know what this is, basically it allows you to have your server as a
    local "drive" on your computer. It's great because its always
    there, its just like moving files on your computer. See your system
    administrator.</p>
    </li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Setting file permissions</h3>
    <p>Whether you are using S/FTP or WebDAV, it is very important to
    set permissions on upload to allow "Read, Write, Execute" (777)
    access and that it applies to all enclosed items.</p>
    <h2>Tips from the trenches</h2>
    <h3>If using Sufolio as a client studio</h3>
    <p>Come up with a standard folder-structure that you can duplicate
    for each client/project.</p>
    <h3>If many users are adding content</h3>
    <p>We recommend that you "jail" them into the
    <code>directory</code> folder and allow access to the
    <code>engine</code> and <code>config</code> folders only to a
    select few. See with your system administrator.</p>
    <h3>Give your local file server an interface</h3>
    <p>You don't have to use Subfolio over the web. You can install it
    locally as a "presentation layer" to your existing file server.
    Just install Subfolio locally and move your existing file structure
    into Subfolio.</p>
</div>


<hr class='pagebreak'><a name='basic-usage-file-naming-restrictions'></a><h1>Basic Usage - File naming & restrictions </h1>
<div>
    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>You can name your files whatever you want, with a few
    exceptions. We've strived to make it so that you can work just like
    you would locally. Unfortunately with the web, there are some
    limitations. Many of the limitation are ones that you have already
    learned to live.</p>
    <h2>Universal characters sets</h2>
    <p>Subfolio supports all language character sets (Unicode) which
    will allow you to use Russian, Arabic or Chinese (for example) most
    anywhere. All settings, enhancer and embedded text files must be
    encoded as <code>Unicode (UTF-8)</code> for them to work
    properly.</p>
    <h2>Using accents and foreign characters without using HTML</h2>
    <p>As long as your text files are saved as <code>Unicode
    (UTF-8)</code> and your server configuration supports it, then you
    don't have to use HTML for accents and special characters.</p>
    <h2>Using foreign accents in file names</h2>
    <p>Foreign accents and characters in file names are supported by
    Subfolio, however they might not be supported by your server. See
    your system administrator for assistance.</p>
    <h2>Unsupported special characters in file names</h2>
    <p>The web just doesn't want <em>you</em> to use certain special
    characters. We know, its selfish of the web to reserve these rights
    all for themselves. We've tried to work around this pertinacious
    behavior so that you can upload your files as they are on your
    computer. But depending on your server configuration, our
    workarounds may not work. See your system administrator for
    assistance.</p>
    <p><em>To be safe, the following special characters should be
    avoided:</em></p>
    <p><code>*</code> <code>'</code> <code>(</code> <code>)</code>
    <code>;</code> <code>:</code> <code>@</code> <code>&amp;</code>
    <code>=</code> <code>+</code> <code>$</code> <code>,</code>
    <code>/</code> <code>?</code> <code>%</code> <code>#</code>
    <code>[</code> <code>]</code></p>
    <h2>File extensions</h2>
    <p>You should use a file extension (eg. .pdf) for all files.
    Subfolio will work without one, however the file will be
    unrecognized and won't take advantage of many Subfolio
    features.</p>
    <p>File extensions can be customized in the file kinds settings
    file at <code>/config/settings/filekinds.yml</code>.</p>
    <h2>Using spaces in filenames</h2>
    <p>You can use spaces in filenames, however in the URL, the space
    will be replaced with <code>%20</code>. We recommend using an
    underscore <code>_</code> instead. Subfolio automatically
    substitute underscores with an actual space within the website
    interface.</p>
    <p>Want to use dashes <code>-</code> instead? Or maybe you'd like
    to turn this feature off? You can configure many interface
    behaviors in the theme options
    <code>/config/themes/default/options.yml</code>.</p>
    <h2>File naming exceptions</h2>
    <p><em>Content in the root of the directory CANNOT be
    named:</em></p>
    <p><code>login</code> <code>logout</code> <code>notfound</code>
    <code>denied</code></p>
    <h2>Naming conventions</h2>
    <p>Since section and page names are pulled from your files and
    folder names, coming up with good naming conventions is important.
    If you are using Subfolio as a client studio, document version
    naming will be important. We have two basic standards: appending a
    version (eg. -v01); or by appending a date (eg. YYMMDD).</p>
</div>



<hr class='pagebreak'><a name='basic-usage-generating-thumbnails'></a><h1>Basic Usage - Generating thumbnails </h1>
<div>
    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>This is where Subfolio really shines. as it was made for
    presenting designs and photography.</p>
    <h2>Auto-generating thumbnails</h2>
    <ol>
    <li>Upload your image or photo files (thumbnails are for
    browser-viewable images only).<br></li>
    <li>Thumbnails will be auto-generated by visiting the folder via
    web browser<br></li>
    <li>Generated thumbnails are automatically stored in a folder named
    <code>-thumbnails/</code><br></li>
    <li>To regenerate thumbnails, simply delete the
    <code>-thumbnails/</code> folder (or a specific thumbnail
    within)</li>
    </ol>
    <h3>Don't make your visitors wait</h3>
    <p>Since the first visit to a folder with images is the trigger for
    thumbnail generation &#8212; depending on how many images you are
    trying to process &#8212; the first visit to that folder is going
    to seem a bit slower. As part of your upload process, make it a
    habit to be the first to visit.</p>
    <h3>Default thumbnail size</h3>
    <p>Thumbnails are generated by resizing the original images to
    240px height and a variable width (in order to maintain the aspect
    ratio). No cropping occurs. You can change the default thumbnail
    size (height only) here:
    <code>/config/themes/default/options.yml</code>.</p>
    <h3>Thumbnails for smaller images</h3>
    <p>If the image file is smaller than the default thumbnail size,
    then a thumbnail will not be created. Instead, the original image
    is displayed vertically aligned in a block the size of a default
    thumbnail.</p>
    <h2>Creating custom thumbnails</h2>
    <ol>
    <li>Create a folder called <em>-thumbnails-custom</em> within the
    same folder your images are in.<br></li>
    <li>Design your custom thumbnails with any size you
    desire.<br></li>
    <li>Upload your custom thumbnails to that folder, giving them the
    same filename as the image it is referencing.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>If a <code>-thumbnails-custom</code> folder exists, any
    thumbnails within will override the <em>-thumbnails</em> folder
    content.</p>
    <h2>IMPORTANT: Thumbnail server settings</h2>
    <p>Thumbnails are generated using something called "GD Library"
    which is going to use your servers processor to generate the
    thumbnails. Meaning, if you upload 1,000 20MB images, your server
    is going to try and process and eventually fail. Each server is
    different, so you will have to find your servers limits.</p>
    <p>By default, images larger than 5MB will not get thumbnails. You
    can change this setting here:
    <code>/config/settings/settings.yml</code>.</p>
</div>


<hr class='pagebreak'><a name='basic-usage-navigating-viewing-and-downloading'></a><h1>Basic Usage - Navigating, viewing and downloading</h1>
<div>
    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>Subfolio inherently has a hierarchical structure, which is
    somewhat "oldschool" in this day of tags and relational
    content.</p>
    <h2>Viewing files</h2>
    <ul>
    <li>Files and folders are shown in a standard file browser list or
    grid view</li>
    <li>List view is sortable by filename, size, date and kind</li>
    <li>Grid view floats and has bigger icons (you can change to grid
    view in config/settings.yml file)</li>
    <li>Browser-viewable images will have thumbnails and will appear
    above the file listing</li>
    <li>Browser-viewable file kinds will appear on their detail
    page</li>
    <li>Files that are new or updated will get a cute little "updated"
    icon</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Navigating files</h2>
    <ul>
    <li>Clicking on a file or thumbnail will lead to a unique detail
    page for that file.</li>
    <li>Navigate from folder-to-folder or file-to-file using
    previous/next buttons</li>
    <li>Keyboard shortcut for navigation: left/right arrows. The 'T'
    key scroll the page to the top.</li>
    <li>Navigate via the "breadcrumb" file path</li>
    <li>Go up one level by clicking "Parent Directory"</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Downloading files</h2>
    <ul>
    <li>Any file can be downloaded from its detail page by clicking on
    the <em>download</em> link</li>
    <li>Browser-viewable file kinds: click the <em>info</em> icon to
    get the <em>download</em> link</li>
    <li>Unknown file kind will get a generic icon and be available for
    download</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Customize the experience</h2>
    <p>Many of the default behaviors listed above can be configured in
    the settings files. Also, there are many cool things you can use
    with Enhancers.</p>
</div>


<hr class='pagebreak'><a name='access-control-creating-users-and-groups'></a><h1>Access Control  - Creating users and groups </h1><div><h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>You can control access on the folder-level by creating users
and/or groups and then restricting access to folders.</p>
<h3>Working with YAML</h3>
<p>Setting files must be encoded as <code>Unicode (UTF-8)</code>
for them to work properly. Setting files use YAML, a human friendly
data serialization standard stored in plaintext files. Indentation,
spacing and text case are super important. Learn more at <a href=
"http://www.yaml.org">yaml.org</a>.<br></p>
<h2>Creating users</h2>
<h3>File location</h3>
<p>You can edit your user here:
<code>/config/users/users.yml</code></p>
<p>For your reference or to revert to the default settings, there
is a sample file here:
<code>/config/settings/users.sample.yml</code></p>
<h3>Format</h3>
<p>The user information is stored in the following format:</p>
<pre>
<code>username:
 fullname: Full Name      
 password: yourpassword
 admin: true or false</code>
</pre>
<p><em>For example:</em></p>
<pre>
<code>john:
 fullname: John Doe
 password: gr8p4ssw0rd
 admin: true</code>
</pre>
<h3>Options</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>username</strong>: users login name</li>
<li><strong>fullname</strong>: will display in breadcrumb when user
is logged in</li>
<li><strong>password</strong>: unsecured plaintext password (see
"hashed passwords" for more security)</li>
<li><strong>admin</strong>: by marking this "true", user will
automatically have full access</li>
</ul>
<h2>Creating groups</h2>
<p>Users can be assigned to one or more groups in order to simplify
access control.</p>
<h3>File location</h3>
<p>You can edit your user here:
<code>/config/users/groups.yml</code></p>
<p>For your reference or to revert to the default settings, there
is a sample file here:
<code>/config/settings/groups.sample.yml</code></p>
<h3>Format</h3>
<p>The group information is stored in the following format:</p>
<pre>
<code>groupname:
 - username01
 - username02
 - etc.</code>
</pre>
<p><em>For example:</em></p>
<pre>
<code>clients:
 - apple
 - google
 - etc.</code>
</pre>
<h3>Options</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>groupname</strong>: name of the group used for access
control</li>
<li><strong>username</strong>: must be an existing user</li>
</ul>
<h2>Tips from the trenches</h2>
<h3>Shared folders</h3>
<p>For us, we have certain files that apply to all clients (eg.
contact lists, ftp login, etc.). In the root of our studio, we
create a folder with access to our client group. And then we create
a shortcut from the client folder to the shared folder. This keeps
our client folders uncluttered and the client has access to the
most up-to-date shared documents.</p>
<h3>Groups are sometimes overkill</h3>
<p>We really only use 3 groups: <code>clients</code>,
<code>freelancers</code> and <code>staff</code>. And for clients,
we rarely create a user for a specific person, but for the entire
client (eg. if google was a client, we'd just create a user called
"google" and then add them to the "client" group).</p></div><hr class='pagebreak'><a name='access-control-hashing-passwords'></a><h1>Access Control  - Hashing passwords </h1><div><h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>Passwords can be encrypted and stored as hashed passwords
instead of unsecured plaintext passwords.</p>
<h2>Hashing a password</h2>
<ol>
<li>Entering the password here:
<code>http://www.yoursite.com/hash/yourpassword</code><br></li>
<li>The page will display the hashed version of the password. Copy
it.<br></li>
<li>In the user information within the <code>users.yml</code> file,
replace the <code>password:</code> option with
<code>hashed_password:</code><br></li>
<li>Replace the plaintext password with the hashed version of the

</pre>
<h2>Retrieving a hashed password</h2>
<p>You cannot retrieve a hashed password. If the user forgot the
password, you will need to rehash a new one.</p></div><hr class='pagebreak'><a name='access-control-allowing-or-denying-access'></a><h1>Access Control  - Allowing or denying access </h1><div><h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>You can allow or deny access to existing users and groups.</p>

for them to work properly. Setting files use YAML, a human friendly
data serialization standard stored in plaintext files. Indentation,

<h2>Access control for a specific folder</h2>
<ol>
<li>Create a plaintext file and name it
<code>-access</code>.<br></li>
<li>Put it in the folder you'd like to protect<br></li>
<li>Add the following code inside it:</li>
</ol>
<p><em>Applies to all sub-folders:</em></p>
<pre>
<code>allow_users: [username, username, etc]
allow_groups: [groupname, groupname, etc]
deny_users: [username, username, etc]
deny_groups: [groupname, groupname, etc]</code>
</pre>
<p><em>Does not apply to sub-folders:</em></p>
<pre>
<code>current_folder:
 allow_users: [username, username, etc]
 allow_groups: [groupname, groupname, etc]
 deny_users: [username, username, etc]
 deny_groups: [groupname, groupname, etc]</code>

<p><em>For example:</em></p>
<pre>
<code>allow_users: [john, jane]
allow_groups: [staff]

current_folder:

</pre>
<p>In this example, John, Jane and anyone who belongs to the group
"staff" have access to this and all sub-folders. Anyone who belongs
to the group "clients" only has access to the current folder.</p>
<h2>Access control for a specific file</h2>
<p>Unfortunately, this is not possible. Permissions work only on
the folder-level. That is, if a user/group has access to a folder,
then they can view/download anything within that folder.</p>
<h2>Tips from the trenches...</h2>
<h3>Internal Folders</h3>
<p>When setting up your folder structures, consider setting up
different folders for different sets of permissions. For example,
at AREA 17, we create an <code>internal/</code> folder within each
client/project folder that denies access to the client. So as we
are working on something, we post to the internal folder and once
we are ready to show the client, we move the work out of the
internal folder.</p>
<h3>Avoiding Gaffes</h3>
<p>If a user/group has access to a folder, they can see all the
content of the folder including folder they do not have access too.
For example, if you create an internal folder like stated above,
the client will see that this folder exists, they just can't access
it. So just name your secured folders prudently.</p>
<h3>As the expression goes, "measure twice, cut once"</h3>
<p>Just because a folder have been secured, that doesn't mean it
has the correct security. Often users in a rush may copy a folder
structure from one client for another &#8212; forgetting to change
the <code>-access</code> file. Later you think its secured since
you see a little lock ... but really the other client has access to
it and the new one doesn't. Doh!</p></div><hr class='pagebreak'><a name='access-control-hiding-from-search-engines'></a><h1>Access Control  - Hiding from search engines </h1><div><h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>Many people want to rank high in search engines, but if you are
just putting together a client studio area, then you don't want it
scattered on the web, especially showing up in your clients name
search results.</p>
<h2>Using a robot text file</h2>
<ol>
<li>Create a plaintext file called <code>robot.txt</code><br></li>
<li>Put it at the root of your domain (the same location as the
<code>/directory/</code>, <code>/config/</code> and
<code>/engine/</code> folders)<br></li>
<li>Add the following code inside it:</li>
</ol>
<pre>
<code># robots.txt for http://www.yourdomain.com/
User-agent: *
Disallow: /</code>
</pre>
<p>Then, add it to the root of your domain (the same location as
the <code>directory/</code>, <code>config/</code> and
<code>engine/</code> folders).</p>

<h1>Settings - General settings (including Google Analytics)</h1>
<div><h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>General settings are where you edit global options (eg. name of
site, preferences, etc.).</p>
<h3>File location</h3>
<p>You can edit your global options and preferences here:
<code>/config/settings/settings.yml</code></p>
<p>For your reference or to revert to the default settings, there
is a sample file here:
<code>/config/settings/settings.sample.yml</code></p>
<h3>Working with YAML</h3>
<p>Setting files must be encoded as <code>Unicode (UTF-8)</code>
for them to work properly. Setting files use YAML, a human friendly
data serialization standard stored in plaintext files. Indentation,
spacing and text case are super important. Learn more at <a href=
"http://www.yaml.org">yaml.org</a>.</p>
<h2>Global Settings</h2>
<h3>Defining the name and url</h3>
<p>Name appears in the header and HTML title of the page. The URL
appears in the breadcrumb navigation.</p>
<h3>Defining the search engine meta description</h3>
<p>You may not know this, but a Subfolio is dangerously SEO
friendly ;) Take control of what search engines display by defining
your site meta description. Keep it under 195 characters.</p>
<p>If you are trying to keep things private, read the documentation
on <a href=
"http://support.subfolio.com/faqs/access-control/hiding-from-search-engines">
hiding from search engines</a>.</p>
<h3>Adding a website content copyright to the footer</h3>
<ul>
<li>locate the line <code># site_copyright: "&copy; 2009 Subfolio
&#8212; All rights reserved"</code></li>
<li>change "Subfolio" to your legal name</li>
<li>remove the <code>#</code> from the front of the line and it
will appear</li>
</ul>
<h3>Adding your Google Analytics code</h3>
<ul>
<li>locate the line <code># google_analytics_code:
"UA-XXXXXX-X"</code></li>
<li>change sample text to your Google Analytics Website Code</li>
<li>remove the <code>#</code> from the front of the line and it
will be activated</li>
<li>please note that Google Analytics may take a bit to verify
it</li>
</ul>
<h2>Content settings</h2>
<h3>Choosing your markup preference (Textile, Markdown or
HTML)</h3>
<p>I like textile, you like markdown and that other guy wants HTML.
OK, quit your bickering, you can choose your flavor. For use in
enhancers files (eg. embedding text, file comments, feature text,
etc.).</p>
<h3>Setting a max file size for thumbnail generation</h3>
<p>Depending on your servers PHP settings, auto-generating
thumbnails for very large images may be problematic. This limit
allows you to set a cap (we recommend 5MB). You can create custom
thumbnails for high resolution images instead.</p>
<h2>Other settings</h2>
<h3>Defining the active theme</h3>
<p>You can install and switch themes as often as you'd like, this
is where you define which is the active theme.</p>
<h3>Defining the location of your content</h3>
<p>The default location is /directory/ however you can rename or
change it all together. If you have multiple file structures, note
that Subfolio will only protect the file structure specified
here.</p>
<h3>Defining the setting file names</h3>
<p>There is probably little reason you'd want to change the name of
your settings files, but if you so desire, you can do it
here.<br></p></div>

<div>
    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>Whether for language translation or because you don't like our
    copyrighting, you can change the interface language within the
    language setting file.</p>
    <h3>File location</h3>
    <p>You can edit your global options and preferences here:
    <code>/config/settings/language.yml</code></p>

    <h2>Changing the interface language</h2>
    <h3>Format</h3>
    <p>The language description are stored in the following format:</p>
    <pre>
    <code>term_or_phrase: display text</code>
    </pre>
    <p><em>For example (French):</em></p>
    <pre>
    <code>download: telecharger</code>
    </pre>
    <h3>Options</h3>
    <p>See <code>language.sample.yml</code> for all options.</p>
    <h2>Multi-language</h2>
    <p>At this time, Subfolio doesn't support multiple language files
    at one time, however it is being considered as a future
    enhancement.</p>
    <h2>Tips from the trenches...</h2>
    <p>If you translate your language file into another language,
    change the name of the file by appending the two-letter language
    suffix (eg. <code>language_fr.yml</code>).</p>

<hr class='pagebreak'><a name='settings-file-kinds'></a><h1>Settings - Managing file kinds </h1><div><h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>You can manage file kinds in the file kind settings.</p>
<ul>
<li>Add new file kinds</li>
<li>Map multiple extensions to one file kind</li>
<li>Change the display name or icon</li>
<li>Add viewing/download instructions</li>
</ul>

"http://www.yaml.org">yaml.org</a>.</p>
<h2>Managing file kinds</h2>
<h3>Format</h3>
<p>The file kinds are stored in the following format:</p>
<pre>
<code>kind:
  extensions: [list, them, like, this]
  icon: kind
  display: Full Name
  instructions:&gt;
    Your instructions here.</code>
</pre>
<p><em>For example:</em></p>
<pre>
<code>pdf:
  extensions: [pdf, pdf-x]
  icon: pdf
  display: PDF Document
  instructions:&gt;
    You must have a PDF viewer to view this file. Download it <a href="http://get.adobe.com/reader/">Adobe Acrobat Reader</a>.</code>
</pre>
<h3>Options</h3>
<ul>
<li><code>kind</code> &#8212; a unique identifier for the file kind
you are defining</li>
<li><code>extensions</code> &#8212;&nbsp;contains a list of file
extensions variations that should use this file kind</li>
<li><code>icon</code> &#8212; used to select the image icon that
will be shown with this file kind*</li>
<li><code>display</code> &#8212; used to display the full name
within the file listing</li>
<li><code>instructions</code> &#8212; used to display download or
usage instructions on the file detail page</li>
</ul>
<p>*Icons live in the theme
<code>/config/theme/default/images/icons</code>. It is used to
generate an image name that varies depending on whether the file
has been recently updates, or the folder access is restricted.</p>
<h2>Mapping extensions or adding new file kinds</h2>
<p>If the file kind exists, however you just need it to recognize a
different form of the extension (eg. jpeg instead of just jpg),
then simply add the extension to the extension list within the file
kind.</p>
<p>If the file kind you want to use does not exist in the list,
then just create a new one by following the format listed
above.</p>

<hr class='pagebreak'><a name='settings-working-with-yaml'></a><h1>Settings - Working with YAML</h1><div><h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>Setting files use YAML, a human friendly data serialization
standard stored in plaintext files. Learn more at <a href=
"http://www.yaml.org">yaml.org</a>.</p>
<h2>Where is it used</h2>
<p>Subfolio uses a limited subset of YAML for settings, options and
enhancer files.</p>
<h2>Commenting within a YAML file</h2>
<p>All text following a <code>#</code> character is considered a
comment.</p>
<h2>Common errors</h2>
<p>Indentation, spacing and text case are super important. If
something is not working, most likely its because of an
indentation, spacing or text case mistake.</p>
<ul>
<li>Indentation is important (spaces only, no tabbing)</li>
<li>Spaces are important (eg. space is different than no
space)</li>
<li>Capitalization is important (eg. &#8220;this&#8221; is
different than &#8220;This&#8221;)</li>
</ul>
<h2>Important encoding note</h2>
<p>YAML files MUST be <code>unicode UTF-8</code> encoded to work
correctly (eg. no Western-Latin, ISO-8859, etc.).</p></div>


<hr class='pagebreak'><a name='themes-theme-options'></a><h1>Themes - Theme options (including logo and favicon) </h1><div><h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>Theme options is where you can configure a theme to your desired
display preferences.</p>
<h3>File location</h3>
<p>The default theme location is here:
<code>/config/themes/default/options.yml</code></p>
<p>For your reference or to revert to the default settings, there
is a sample file here:
<code>/config/themes/default/options.sample.yml</code></p>
<h3>Working with YAML</h3>
<p>Option files must be encoded as <code>Unicode (UTF-8)</code> for
them to work properly. Option files use YAML, a human friendly data
serialization standard stored in plaintext files. Indentation,
spacing and text case are super important. Learn more at <a href=
"http://www.yaml.org">yaml.org</a>.</p>
<h2>Adding your logo</h2>
<p>Replace the Subfolio logo URL path with your logo URL path. Use
a full path to an external location or a relative path and put your
logo here: <code>config/themes/default/images/logos/</code>.</p>
<h2>Adding your favicon</h2>
<p>Replace the Subfolio favicon URL path with your logo URL path.
Use a full path to an external location or a relative path and put
your favicon here:
<code>config/themes/default/images/logos/</code>.</p>
<p>Remember that your browser will retain the old favicon until you
delete it from your browser. See your browser help for instructions
on how to delete existing favicons or search Google with "removing
favicon for [yourbrowsername]".</p>
<h2>Choosing a color palette</h2>
<p>You can change or create new color palettes. To learn more, see
<a href=
"http://support.subfolio.com/faqs/themes/color-palettes">color
palettes</a> documentation</p>
<h2>Choosing your default thumbnail size</h2>
<p>You can choose the default height and width of your thumbnails.
You can also customize thumbnails to a specific size using the
custom thumbnail feature.</p>
<h2>Choose whether you want locked folders to be hidden or
not</h2>
<p>If you are using access control, you can opt to hide locked
folders from users who don't have access to them.</p>
<h2>Choosing your preference for spaces in file names</h2>
<p>You can use spaces in filenames, however in the URL, the space
will be replaced with %20. We recommend using an underscore
<code>_</code> or dash <code>-</code> instead.</p>
<p>Here, you can choose to automatically substitute underscores or
dashes with an actual space within the website interface. It makes
the file listings more readable and is especially useful when using
Subfolio as a portfolio or public website.</p>
<h2>Choosing your preference for how file names are displayed</h2>
<p>Do you want to show extensions or hide them? File names under
thumbnails or not? Etc. If you are using Subfolio as a client
studio, then most likely you want to show all this information, but
if you are using it as a portfolio or public website, you may want
to keep it simple and hide it all.</p>
<h2>Choosing your preference for how files are displayed (list or
grid)</h2>
<p>Subfolio shows your files by default in a list view. However you
can change it to a grid view if you'd like. Grid view uses bigger
icons and displays only the comments (if applicable).</p>
<h2>Choose your icon set</h2>
<p>The default theme comes with three icon sets:</p>
<ol>
<li><code>list</code> and <code>grid</code>: 8bit icons that work
IE6 (default)<br></li>
<li><code>list1</code> and <code>grid1</code>: 1bit icons that give
an old school feel<br></li>
<li><code>list24</code> and <code>grid24</code>: 24bit alpha icons
that display as we intended (preferred)</li>
</ol>
<h2>Choosing your preference for interface elements
display</h2>
<p>You can turn on/off any of the interface elements and links in
the header, footer and file listing, including icons and file names
themselves.</p>
<h2>Showing your copyright</h2>
<p>In <code>/config/settings/settings.yml</code> you can add a
copyright. Here you can opt to show it or not.<br></p></div>


<hr class='pagebreak'><a name='themes-color-palettes'></a><h1>Themes - Color Palettes </h1><div><h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>A color palette is a stand-alone yml file that works with a
theme. It allow you to change all the colors of the theme without
changing the theme itself.</p>
<h3>File location (default theme)</h3>
<p>The default theme comes with two color palettes (default.yml and
dark.yml).</p>
<p>The color palette location is here:
<code>/config/themes/default/colors/</code></p>
<h2>Choosing a color palette</h2>
<ol>
<li>Go to <code>config/themes/default/options.yml</code><br></li>
<li>Find the color palette option and change (eg. "default" or
"dark")<br></li>
<li>You don't need to include the extension ".yml"<br></li>
<li>Save.</li>
</ol>
<h2>Creating a new color palette</h2>
<ol>
<li>duplicate another color palette and rename it (eg.
milkywhite.yml)<br></li>
<li>Update the main colors (format: '#FF0000')<br></li>
<li>Main colors will be used for other secondary colors<br></li>
<li>Use the "optional colors" if you'd like to control
everything</li>
</ol>
<h2>NOTE: Working with icons</h2>
<p>You may need to change your icon set to 1bit or 24bit alpha if
using dark background. Or better yet, create your own icon set! You
can change icon set in
<code>/config/themes/default/options.yml</code> file.</p></div>



<hr class='pagebreak'><a name='themes-switching-theme'></a><h1>Themes - Switching themes </h1><div><h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>A theme is the presentation layer of Subfolio. It is a folder
that contains all the interface elements (eg. html, css, images,
etc.) so that you can have full control of the look without
changing the functionality.</p>
<h3>File location (default theme)</h3>
<p>Subfolio is prepackaged with the "default" theme however you can
install and switch themes as often as you'd like.</p>
<p>The default theme location is here:
<code>/config/themes/default/</code></p>
<h2>Switching themes</h2>
<ol>
<li>Download additional themes at subfolio.com or
support.subfolio.com<br></li>
<li>Drop them here: <code>/config/themes/</code><br></li>
<li>Go to: <code>/config/settings/settings.yml</code> and edit
<code>theme: default</code> to the new theme name<br></li>
<li>Subfolio will now use the new theme, you can change back at
anytime</li>
</ol>
<h2>NOTE: Before you switch</h2>
<p>A theme is not dependant on the Subfolio engine, which makes it
easy to switch themes with ease. However sometimes a specific theme
may require changes to settings or the usage of enhancers.</p>
<p><strong>Before you switch themes, it is very important to read
the theme release notes, and as always, make backups of your
work.</strong></p></div>

<hr class='pagebreak'><a name='themes-customizing-themes'></a><h1>Themes - Customizing themes </h1><div><h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>We have gone to great lengths to abstract the presentation layer
of Subfolio from the functional layer in order to allow you (and
us) to create many different themes for a variety of different
purposes.</p>
<p><strong>Default theme:</strong> The default theme was built to
be simple so that it can act as the base for new themes. Of course
the default theme can be used as is or with simple color changes.
But you can go nuts and add navigation, graphics, flashy
JavaScript, etc.</p>
<h2>Customizing your theme</h2>
<ol>
<li>Duplicate and rename the default theme<br></li>
<li>Change the css, layout and pages as desired<br></li>
<li>If you are building a new theme from the ground up, get to know
the API's<br></li>
<li>When finished, change your theme name here:
<code>/config/settings/settings.yml</code></li>
</ol>
<h2>Theme location</h2>
<p>You can find the default theme here:
<code>/config/themes/default/</code></p>
<p>We recommend that you do not modify the default theme, even for
small changes. This way you have a clean reference. Always
duplicate, rename and change the theme name here:
<code>/config/settings/settings.yml</code>.</p>
<h2>Structure</h2>
<ul>
<li><code>layout/</code> &#8212;&nbsp;global template including the
header, footer and previous/next navigation</li>
<li><code>pages/</code> &#8212;&nbsp;specific pages, including the
listing and file kind modified behaviors</li>
<li><code>pages/listing/</code> &#8212; specific pieces of the
listing including features, files/folders, thumbnail gallery,
inline text/images and related content</li>
<li><code>pages/filekinds/</code> &#8212; this is where we modify
the default behavior of a specific file kind</li>
<li><code>images/</code> &#8212; logos, icons and system graphics.
If you other types of graphics, create a new folder</li>
<li><code>css/</code> &#8212; the CSS silly</li>
<li><code>javascript/</code> &#8212; javascript files, Subfolio
uses jquery</li>
<li><code>colors/</code> &#8212; location of color palettes</li>
<li><code>options.yml</code> &#8212; file with all the options for
the theme</li>
</ul>
<h2>Options</h2>
<p>One of the idea behind Subfolio is that you are not forced into
one way of doing things. When working on a new theme, we recommend
considering as many of the standard options as possible.</p>
<h2>Subfolio API</h2>
<p>The Subfolio API is made up of 5 classes:</p>

<p>If you code PHP and want to change or extend the Subfolio
engine, go for it. Just remember that you may no longer be able to
take advantage of our updates and upgrades.</p></div>



<hr class='pagebreak'><a name='enhancers-intro_to_enhancers'></a>
<h1>Enhancers - Intro to enhancers </h1><div><h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>Subfolio enhancers are simple plaintext files or naming
conventions that changes the behavior of files and folders (eg.
embedding text or images) or sometimes creates a behavior that
normally doesn't exist within a file system (eg. external links,
pop-up windows, etc).</p>
<h2>How do they work</h2>
<p>A file browser is not a website for a reason... its just a list
of files. But sometimes you want to do more and that is where
enhancers come in.</p>
<p>Their are two types of enhancers:</p>
<ol>
<li>Naming conventions: this is when you append a prefix or suffix
to an existing file or folder to change its behavior (eg. add the
suffix .site to a folder to turn it into an HTML prototype
folder)<br></li>
<li>Stand alone plaintext files: this is a snippet of code that
does something cool (eg. if you want to feature a folder or put an
external link in the file listing)</li>
</ol>
<h2>Where are they stored</h2>
<p>Enhancers are stored alongside your content, not in a database
or in some global folder. Why? In practice, Subfolio makes it easy
to move your files around often and its handy to have them right
with the content they belong with. We like to consider enhancers as
part of the content. Its like having a link to a website locally on
your desktop or organized with some other documents.</p></div>

<h3>Working with YAML</h3>
<p>Enhancer files must be encoded as <code>Unicode (UTF-8)</code>
for them to work properly. Enhancer files use YAML, a human
friendly data serialization standard stored in plaintext files.
Indentation, spacing and text case are super important. Learn more
at <a href="http://www.yaml.org">yaml.org</a>.</p>
<h2>Embedding images within a folder</h2>
<p>Any browser-viewable image can be embedded within a folder (eg.
if you'd like to add a logo to the top of the page). There is no

<li>Features always display at the top of the page</li>
</ul>
<h3>Misc. Hints:</h3>
<ul>
<li>To hide the title, thumbnail or description, put # in front of
that line.</li>
<li>Default margin is 15px</li>
<li>Standard size 249x159, however you can do what you'd like</li>
</ul>

<h2>Featuring a file</h2>
<p>Follow the same steps as "featuring a folder", except:</p>
<ul>
<li>remove the line: <code>folder: Exact folder name</code></li>
<li>Add the line: <code>file: Exact file name</code></li>
</ul>
<h2>Featuring a link (or a specific page)</h2>
<p>Follow the same steps as "featuring a folder", except:</p>
<ul>
<li>remove the line: <code>folder: Exact folder name</code></li>
<li>Add the line: <code>link: http://www.example.com</code></li>
</ul>
<h2>Creating a slideshow</h2>
<p>By default, Subfolio creates thumbnails for all images. But if
you'd rather have users skip the thumbnails and go directly to the
first image, then you can use a slideshow enhancer.</p>
<ul>
<li>Add a <code>.slide</code> extension to any folder</li>
<li>User will go directly to the first image (or file) in that
folder</li>
<li>User can then use the prev/next navigation to go through your
images (or files)</li>
</ul>
<h2>Display an RSS Feed</h2>
<p>The RSS enhancer allows you to take any RSS feed from anywhere
and display it within Subfolio. It could be used as a stand alone
file (eg. example.rss) or as an embedded text file (eg.
-t-example.rss).</p>
<ul>
<li>Create a plain text file</li>
<li>Add a <code>-t-</code> or <code>-m-</code> or <code>-b-</code>
to the beginning of the filename if you'd like to embed it</li>
<li>Give it the extension <code>.rss</code></li>
<li>Within the file, put the following YAML code:</li>
</ul>
<pre>
<code>feedurl: http://feeds.example.com
count: 10
cache: 3600</code>
</pre>
<ul>
<li>Count is the maximum number of items to show</li>
<li>Cache is number of seconds to cache the feed for</li>
<li>Note: It may take a minute or so to work for the first
time.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Displaying HTML pages or prototypes</h2>
<ul>
<li>Create a folder</li>
<li>Name it whatever you'd like</li>
<li>Add a <code>.site</code> extension</li>
</ul>
<pre>
<code>-example_folder.site</code>
</pre>
<ul>
<li>Place your html files within</li>
<li>The file index.html must exist</li>
<li>The folder will open in a new window outside of Subfolio</li>
</ul>
<h2>Adding a comment to a folder or file</h2>
<ul>
<li>Create a plain text file</li>
<li>Give it the exact same name (including extension) of the folder
or file</li>
<li>Add a <code>.info</code> extension</li>
</ul>
<pre>
<code>example.jpg.info</code>
</pre>
<ul>
<li>Within the file, put the following YAML code:</li>
</ul>
<pre>
<code>comment: your comment goes here.</code>
</pre>
<ul>
<li>Put the file in the same location of the folder or file</li>
</ul>
<h2>Specifying video properties</h2>
<p>Unfortunately, there is no way for Subfolio to detect the
properties of a video file. Therefore you need to specify them in
the following way. You can also put a standard size for your video
files within the file kinds settings file.</p>
<ul>
<li>Create a plain text file</li>
<li>Give it the exact same name (including extension) of the video
file</li>
<li>Add a <code>.info</code> extension</li>
</ul>
<pre>
<code>example_video.mov.info</code>
</pre>
<ul>
<li>Within the file, put the following YAML code:</li>
</ul>
<pre>
<code>width: width
  height: height
  autoplay: false or true (default false)</code>
</pre>
<ul>
<li>For example:</li>
</ul>
<pre>
<code>width: 640
height: 500
autoplay: true</code>
</pre>
<ul>
<li>Put the file in the same location of the video file</li>
</ul></div>


<hr class='pagebreak'><a name='enhancers-using-markup-in-enhancers'></a><h1>Enhancers - Using markup in enhancers </h1><div><h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>A markup language is a system for annotating a text in a way
which is syntactically distinguishable from that text (eg. HTML,
XML). These days we have lightweight markup languages that make it
easy to style text without the baggage (eg. Textile, Markdown).</p>
<h2>Using markup in enhancers</h2>
<p>Markup can be used to style text within enhancers files.
Subfolio uses Textile by default, however you can change this to
Markdown or HTML in your general settings:
<code>_config/settings/settings.yml</code>.</p></div>

<h1>Misc. Helpers - Recommended 3rd-party apps </h1><div><h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>Well, you probably have your favorites. But if you don't, here's
what we use.</p>
<h2>Text Editors (for settings and enhancers)</h2>
<p><strong>Mac:</strong> The developers are using <a href=
"http://macromates.com">TextMate</a> and the rest of us are using
TextEdit.</p>
<p><strong>PC:</strong>&nbsp;The developers are using <a href=
"http://www.e-texteditor.com">E-TextEditor</a> and the rest of us
are using Notebook.</p>
<p><strong>File encoding note:</strong> Make sure your file
encoding is set to <code>Unicode (UTF-8)</code>.</p>
<h2>S/FTP (for uploading content)</h2>
<p><strong>Mac:</strong>&nbsp;Most of us are using the all-in-one
<a href="http://www.panic.com/coda">Coda</a>, but some of us use
<a href="http://www.panic.com/transmit">Transmit</a>.</p>
<p><strong>PC:</strong>&nbsp;We're using <a href=
"http://filezilla-project.org">FileZilla</a> ... cause its free and
good. Never tried the Mac version.</p>
<p><strong>File encoding note:</strong> Make sure your file
encoding is set to <code>Unicode (UTF-8)</code>.</p>
<h2>Web developer tools</h2>
<p>We can't live without the Firefox plugin <a href=
"http://getfirebug.com">Firebug</a>.</p></div>

    <h2>File permissions</h2>
    <p>Different FTP users may generate different permissions</p>
    <p>Make sure your FTP client is set to 777</p>

<hr class='pagebreak'><a name='solving-common-problems-thumbnail-errors'></a>
<h1>Solving Common Problems - Thumbnail errors</h1><div><h1>Allowed memory size exhausted</h1>
<p><strong>Problem</strong> When your server PHP configuration does
not have enough memory to create the thumbnail from the image
(based on file size) this will error occur.</p>
<p><strong>Solution</strong> You need to see with your system
administrator if you can allocate more memory. Otherwise, we have
added a setting called thumbnail_max_filesize&#8217; so that
Subfolio knows to not try and generate a thumbnail for image files
that are larger that your server PHP configuration allows.</p></div>
