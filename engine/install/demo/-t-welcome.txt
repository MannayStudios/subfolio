h2. Welcome to your Subfolio


h3. Quick Start

There is little-to-nothing you _need_ to know about Subfolio to get started with basic usage. 

_Below are a few things that you may want to know:_


h4. Starting to use it immediately

* Add files and folders to the _directory_ folder and Subfolio will create pages from files and sections from folders
* Thumbnails will be generated automatically for any image files
* Play around and get a feel of how it behaves, Subfolio supports most file kinds

h4. Giving it a name

* Go to /config/settings/settings.yml and change the name of your website and the URL
* For fun, take a look at all the other settings files

h4. Adding your logo

* Go to /config/themes/default/options.yml and replace the Subfolio logo
* In the same location, there are other options to turn on and off interface elements

h4. Delete this file

* This file (the one you're reading) is an _Enhancer_ for embedding text into a page. Don't forget to delete it before you go live:
   * It's in the _directory_ folder and it's named "-t-welcome.txt".
* Learn to use Enhancers at "support.subfolio.com":http://support.subfolio.com

h3. Explore the possibilities

h4. Making it private

* If you are using Subfolio for private purposes, make sure you add access control
* This is done by setting up a user at /config/users/users.yml
* Then adding a _-access_ file with the user permissions to the folder you'd like to protect
* Read all about access control at "support.subfolio.com":http://support.subfolio.com

h4. Making it your own

* Change your interface options at /config/themes/default/options.yml
* Learn to use Enhancers at "support.subfolio.com":http://support.subfolio.com
* You are looking at the _Default Theme_. Themes are interchangeable. Choose a theme that fits your needs
* If you know a bit of HTML/CSS, feel free to customize a theme or create your own

h4. Don't read the documentation

* Everything should work out-of-the-box

h4. Read the documentation

* If you hit any bumps in your path
* Also there are a lot of hidden features to take advantage of, read it at "support.subfolio.com":http://support.subfolio.com

h3. And a few fast tips...

h4. Embedding images and text into the page

* Add a _–t–_ or _–m–_ or _–b–_ to the beginning of any txt or image file name to embed it at the _top_ or _middle_ or _bottom_ of the page

h4. Hiding content

* Put a dash at the start of a file or folder name and it will disappear from the listing
* You can still access hidden content directly via URL
* It's a nice way to work on a part of your Subfolio in private (just remove the dash when you are done)

h4. For clean URL's, don't use spaces in filenames

* Subfolio will replace all underscores and dashes with a space on the website itself
* You can turn this option off in _/config/themes/default/options.yml_
* And of course, feel free to use spaces if you want

h4. Getting system information

* Add /engine/info to the end of your domain (eg. http://www.example.com/engine/info)
