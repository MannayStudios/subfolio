h4. Making it private

* If you are using Subfolio for private purposes, make sure you add access control
* This is done by setting up a user at /config/users/users.yml
* Then adding a _-access_ file with the user permissions to the folder you'd like to protect
* Read the access control "documentation":http://www.subfolio.com/documentation for full instructions

h4. Making it your own

* Change your interface options at /config/themes/default/options.yml
* Learn to use "Enhancers":http://www.subfolio.com/documentation to feature items and much more
* Download a package of "example Enhancers":http://www.subfolio.com/download to play with
* Themes are interchangeable. Choose a theme that fits your needs
* If you know a bit of HTML/CSS, feel free to customize a theme or create your own

h4. Read the documentation

* There are a lot of hidden features to take advantage of, read the "documentation":http://www.subfolio.com/documentation to know your options

h3. And a few fast tips...

h4. Embedding images and text into the page

* Add a _&ndash;t&ndash;_ or _&ndash;m&ndash;_ or _&ndash;b&ndash;_ to the beginning of any txt or image file name to embed it at the _top_ or _middle_ or _bottom_ of the page

h4. Hiding content

* Put a dash at the start of a file or folder name and it will disappear from the listing
* You can still access hidden content directly via URL
* It's a nice way to work on a part of your Subfolio in private (just remove the dash when you are done)

h4. Using dashes or underscores instead of spaces in filenames

* You can use spaces for your filenames, but it's better to use underscores as it will make your URL's cleaner
* Subfolio will replace all underscores and dashes with a space on the website itself
* You can turn this option off in _/config/themes/default/options.yml_

h4. Getting system information

* Visit the following URL on your domain: http://www.example.com/engine/info
