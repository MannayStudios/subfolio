h4. Does Subfolio have special hosting needs? (Shared vs. dedicated hosting)

The short answer is no. Subfolio was made to just drop onto your server and for it to work immediately. You can use it with Shared Hosting or on a Dedicated Server. Most everything works on a shared server, however for some features (such as using special characters in URL's) you may need control of the server, which requires dedicated servers.
