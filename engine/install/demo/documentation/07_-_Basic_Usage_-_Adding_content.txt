h1. Basic Usage

h2. Adding Content

The structure is already in place and you only need to drop your files onto your server for them to display in the Front-end.

h3. FTP

* FTP unlimited number of folders and files onto your server and the Subfolio engine will display them.

bq. Location to drop your folders and files: /directory

h3. Structure

* The Front-end view is an exact mirror of what is on your server.
* Any folder you upload on your server will become a section in the Front-end.
* All files included in a folder will appear in the corresponding section in the Front-end.

h3. File types

You can upload most standard file types. If a file type is not recognized, it will be shown as generic.

h4. How do i add other unlisted file types on my own?

You can add your file types to the config/settings/filekinds.yml file.

h3. Thumbnails

* After you upload an image, thumbnails are auto generated when someone visits the Front-end for the first time.
* So when you upload images on your server, make sure to visit the Front-end right after. This way, users (especially your clients) will not have to wait for thumbnails to generate.
* Thumbnail specifications: Resize original image to height of 240 pixels, using height to maintain aspect ratio. (this height can be set in the settings.yml file). Files bigger than a defined weight will not get thumbnails. (this maximum height can be defined in the setting file).
* Once thumbnails have been created, they are automatically stored on the server in a folder named -thumbnails.
* If the image is smaller than the thumbnail size (320x240) then no thumbnail is created and the original image is displayed in its place.

h4. How do i create custom thumbnails?

* Create a “-thumbnails-custom” folder and drop here your own customized thumbnails
* You can give a custom thumbnail the look and size you wish
* You need to give it the name of the image you want it to be the thumbnail for. 
* Upload this folder at the level of the auto generated folder

h3. Naming conventions

h4. Can i use foreign accents and special characters?

* Foreign accents in filenames are only supported if you web server allows them.
* We recommend to avoid special characters when possible as your web server may not allow use of them (eg. “#”, “?”, “%”, “&”, “*”, “@”).
* We recommend to replace spaces with underscores ( _ ) in file names. Underscores will be replaced by spaces on the front-end. This is made to keep urls clean.

h4. Can i name content the way i want (Restricted names)

 To avoid conflict between existing files and new ones, content in the root of the directory cannot be named:
* login
* logout
* notfound
* denied

h3. Can i hide content?

- Yes, any folder or file on your server starting with a ‘-’ are considered hidden and will not appear in the Front-end.
