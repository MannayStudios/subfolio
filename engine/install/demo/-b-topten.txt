h3. Top ten things you need to know

1. Putting a dash "-" before any filename will make it disappear from the page.
You can still access it. It's a nice way to work on your site and show things only when you are ready to.

2. Use underscores instead of spaces
		You can use spaces for your filenames, but it's better to use underscores "_", we replace them with spaces, it's cleaner that way.
		
3. Don't fight it
		Subfolio creates pages from the content of folders, it has expected behaviors that you can learn. Have fun with it, don't fight it.
		Images show up as thumbnails, the rest as files and folders. Enhancers will give you more possibilities.
		
4. Security
		With Subfolio you can show your work to the world or to just a few people, even on the same website. That's the beauty of it. We created a powerful way to manage access, just drag and drop an access file in your directory and it's protected. See the enhancers folder for a sample file.
		
5. Inline images and text
		Every images and text files can show up inline (not in the form of an icon or thumbnail). Just add -t- to the beginning of your filename, or -m- or -b- and you'll get an inline asset showing up at the top, middle or bottom of the page.
