h1. Subfolio Basic Setup

h2. Quick Start


h3. Things you most likely want to do...

h4. Give it a name

* Go to: /config/settings/settings.yml and do your thing
* Here you should also add your URL, site meta data and optionally a copyright
* You can add your Google Analytics code here too

h4. Add your logo

* Put your logo here: /config/themes/default/images/logos/
* Go to: /config/themes/default/options.yml and adjust the file name, if needed
* Alternatively, you can link directly to an external image

h4. Or use a text-only logo

* Go to: /config/themes/default/options.yml
* Add a "#" in front of the logo line of code
* Example: # site_logo_url: /config/themes/default/images/logos/logo.png
* The name (described above) will be used

h4. Localization

* Subfolio supports foreign/special characters
* Make sure all your files are set to "Unicode (UTF-8)"
* Change your interface language here: /config/settings/language.yml

h4. iPhone and Android support

* Visit your subfolio via your mobile device to see it in action

h4. Remove these welcome files

* The file you are now reading is part of the "welcome files" located in the directory folder
* The directory folder is for *your* content
* Delete all welcome files before you deploy on the world wide web
* Very important because Subfolio is extremely SEO-friendly

h3. And a few fast tips...

h4. Embedding text and images into the page

To the beginning of any text or image file name:
* Append &ndash;t&ndash; to embed at the *top* of the page
* Append &ndash;m&ndash; to embed at the *middle* of the page
* Append &ndash;b&ndash; to embed at the *bottom* of the page

h4. Hiding content

* Put a dash at the start of a file or folder name and it will disappear from the listing
* You can still access hidden content directly via URL
* It's a nice way to work on a part of your Subfolio in private (just remove the dash when you are done)

h4. For clean URL's, don't use spaces in filenames

* Subfolio will replace all underscores (or dashes) with a space on the interface
* To turn this off, or to use dashes instead, go to: /config/themes/default/options.yml
* And of course, feel free to use spaces if you want

h4. Getting system information

h4. Dig around

Most everything should be pretty self explanatory. Check out the /config/ folder, its loaded with settings that allow you to customize and personalize Subfolio with no development skills. For example, see what you can do with this file: /config/themes/default/options.yml ... and you're on your way.

h4. Read the documentation

Subfolio is configurable, customizable and feature rich. For documentation on access control, language, file kinds, themes, etc., visit "support.subfolio.com":http://support.subfolio.com.

h4. Download the enhancer demo files
