ABOUT SUBFOLIO

Subfolio provides an elegant, practical and customizable web interface to your file system. Super fast to set-up and use, you’ll be up and running in minutes. Flexible and feature-rich, you’ll soon be inventing new ways to use it.

Subfolio is made for creative types to share their work online with speed and elegance — publicly or privately. It’s good for freelancers, studios, agencies, enterprise or even the classroom.

Subfolio is a lightweight PHP5 file browser app that installs on your own server. No database or content management needed. And for you geeks out there, it’s extensible too.
